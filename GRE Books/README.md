## These, in our opinion, are the most relevant books for GRE Prep that you can choose from.<br/>
### But based on its reputation and advice from our own seniors, we both chose to prefer Manhattan 5lb over the other books.<br/>
### About Manhattan 5lb -
- It is a very well structured book and is apt for almost all sub-types of questions asked in GRE.<br/>
- It is extremely good when it comes to the Quantitative and matches the level of actual GRE quite well. 
- In the verbal it is an excellent choice for practicing Reading Comprehensions and Logical Comprehensions because, the way in which the comprehensions, questions and the answer choices in the questions are structured mirror the original GRE.
- For Sentence Equivalence, it is an amazing start to help you build your thought process initially and understand the nuances like picking the correct pair of words and not the (seemingly) most correct single word answer. (Yes! This can be a bit tricky at times!)
- It is also a good choice to practice Text Completion questions.

### Apart from Manhattan 5lb, we also purchased a Magoosh GRE account and practiced mainly Verbal questions -
- That added to the variety of questions we practiced.
- Reading Comprehensions and Sentence Equivalence questions get tougher here and hence if you intend to include this into your prep, do that only in the later stages of your preparation.
- They categorize the questions as Easy, Medium, Difficult and Very Difficult and thus you can have a metric to judge yourself.
- There are video solutions to each and every question which will help you build your thought process behind how to eliminate a few options, which options to shortlist and even how to take a calculated guess at times.
- They keep a track of the number of questions you got right and their difficulty levels and give you an estimated GRE score section-wise that you can expect. (It was pretty accurate for me as my expected GRE score according to Magoosh was Verbal - 160 and Quant - 169)
- You can have your practice sessions tailored according to your needs for Verbal and Quant separately. 

### Official ETS Verbal Reasoning & Quant Practice Books
- ETS books are awesome, but my suggestion is that instead of going for the official guide, solve the verbal practice book
and the quant practice book.
- You can solve the mock tests given in the official guide too!
