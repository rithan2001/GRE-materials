## One area where almost every GRE Patricipant is worried and most certainly lagging is Vocabulary. Vocab Prep forms a very important part of the GRE prep and in our opinion, is the toughest part. Hence, we would like to share with you, the strategy we followed to tackle this issue.

### Magoosh Flashcards.
- In our opinion, this list of 1000 words is the bible of GRE Vocab. Every person who intends to appear for GRE should, at the very least, know every single word in the **Basic Words** and **Common Words** decks. It would be advisable to go through the **Advance Words** decks too if one has time.
- Keep on practicing the words every day, repeat the decks every week, and make your own list of words you tend to forget. A demo list that Dhruva prepared for his own prep is attached in this directory. I personally preferred writing the words down in my notebook instead.

### Barrons' (800) High Frequency Words.
- This is also a very good compilation of words and if one has time, it is advisable to go through this list as well. 
- In my case, I had very little time to go through this list but Dhruva did go though almost all of it and found it very helpful.

#### The most important thing is to practice!! Apply the words you learn in your day-to-day conversations with your friends and family. Me and Dhruva used to do that frequently. Become a 'word-nerd'! Whenever you see a new word, note it down and Google it asap. Remember it, and don't forget it!

Happy Nerding!<br/>
Best,<br/>
Amogh & Dhruva.
